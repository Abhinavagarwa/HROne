Drag-free field builder â€“ add String, Number, or Nested fields easily
What the Code is doing:
-Each field has:
    -key: editable field name
    -type: "String" | "Number" | "Nested"
    -children: nested fields (if type is Nested)
-Clicking Add Field appends a new field of that type.
-Nested fields can be collapsed/expanded.
-JSON output is updated in real-time and can be copied with one click.
